To run and time:
time python engine.py

The directory containing the files to be checked is given at the top of the source.  By default the script expects the speech files to be in the folder "0786036/" in the same directory.

The default threshold for near duplicates is 0.95 (speeches that are 95% the same).
This can be changed at the top of the source by changing DUPE_THRESHOLD.
